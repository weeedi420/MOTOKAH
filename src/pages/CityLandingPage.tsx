const cityGuideContent: Record<string, { heading: string; body: string }> = {
  "dar-es-salaam": {
    heading: "Buying a Car in Dar es Salaam",
    body: "Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's commercial capital and the largest car market in the country. The main car-trading hubs are along Morogoro Road, Nyerere Road, and in the Kariakoo and Mikocheni areas, where you'll find hundreds of dealers offering both locally used vehicles and direct Japanese imports. Toyota dominates the market — the Land Cruiser, Hilux, Vitz and IST are among the most popular models due to their reliability on Tanzania's varied road conditions. Nissan X-Trail, Honda CRV and Suzuki Escudo are also in high demand. When buying in Dar es Salaam, always verify the vehicle's TIN (Tax Identification Number), check the chassis number against SUMATRA records, and confirm import duty has been paid in full. Getting a pre-purchase inspection from a mechanic in Sinza or Ubungo is strongly advised before committing to any sale.",
  },
  "arusha": {
    heading: "Buying a Car in Arusha",
    body: "Arusha is the gateway to Tanzania's northern safari circuit, and the local car market reflects this — four-wheel-drive vehicles, Landcruiser Prado, Hilux double-cabs, and Land Rover Defenders are particularly sought after for game drives and highland roads to Kilimanjaro and the Ngorongoro Crater. The main car market runs along the Nairobi Highway and around the Clock Tower roundabout, with dealers stocking both city hatchbacks for urban use and heavy-duty off-roaders for tour operators. Arusha buyers often source vehicles imported via Dar es Salaam or directly from Nairobi, so verifying import documentation is important. Prices here trend slightly higher than in Dar es Salaam for comparable 4x4 models due to strong demand from tourism businesses.",
  },
  "nairobi": {
    heading: "Buying a Car in Nairobi",
    body: "Nairobi is the biggest car market in East Africa. Kirinyaga Road in the CBD is Kenya's most famous car-dealer strip, lined with hundreds of showrooms selling Japanese imports, locally used cars, and ex-expat vehicles. Other major hubs include Ngong Road, Mombasa Road, and Industrial Area. Toyota is the most popular brand, with the Corolla, Probox, Land Cruiser and Prado selling in huge volumes. Subaru Forester, Impreza and Legacy are beloved in the Kenyan market for their all-weather performance in the highlands. When buying in Nairobi, insist on a NTSA inspection certificate, check the logbook (V5) carefully, and use a licensed clearing agent for any imported vehicle. Insurance is mandatory from day one. Nairobi's traffic means fuel efficiency is a top priority — hybrid options like the Toyota Axio Hybrid and Honda Fit Hybrid are gaining popularity fast.",
  },
  "mombasa": {
    heading: "Buying a Car in Mombasa",
    body: "Mombasa is Kenya's major port city and a primary entry point for imported vehicles in East Africa. Many buyers travel to Mombasa specifically to purchase vehicles fresh off the boat before they are transported upcountry, which can mean better prices and more import options. The main car market areas are along Moi Avenue, Digo Road, and the Changamwe industrial zone near the port. Japanese imports — especially Toyota, Nissan, and Honda — dominate the market. The coastal climate means buyers should check vehicle undercarriages carefully for rust and salt corrosion, particularly on older imports. Mombasa dealers are generally experienced with import documentation, KRA duty payments, and NTSA registration, making the paperwork process more straightforward than in inland cities.",
  },
  "kampala": {
    heading: "Buying a Car in Kampala",
    body: "Kampala is Uganda's fastest-growing car market, with demand driven by a rapidly expanding middle class and strong road infrastructure investment. The main car-trading areas are in Kampala Industrial Area along Jinja Road, Kireka, and the Nakawa market. Japanese imports are the backbone of the market — Toyota Harrier, Land Cruiser Prado, Hiace minibuses, and Nissan X-Trail are top sellers. Uganda drives on the left and imports primarily right-hand-drive vehicles. When buying in Kampala, check that the vehicle's URA (Uganda Revenue Authority) import declaration is complete, the chassis plate matches documents, and the vehicle passes roadworthiness inspection. Car hire businesses, NGOs, and construction companies are active buyers in Kampala, which keeps the quality of available stock high.",
  },
  "kigali": {
    heading: "Buying a Car in Kigali",
    body: "Kigali has one of the cleanest, most regulated car markets in East Africa. Rwanda has strict vehicle age restrictions — vehicles older than 10 years (and in some categories 5 years) are restricted from import, meaning the average age of cars on Kigali roads is younger than in neighbouring countries. Toyota, Honda and Volkswagen are popular brands. The Kigali car market is concentrated around Gisozi and Kimironko, with a growing number of formal showrooms alongside private sellers. Rwanda uses a plastic bag ban and stringent environmental standards, attracting cleaner, well-maintained vehicles. Import duty and VAT are applied on CIF value, so buyers should account for full landed costs when budgeting. Kigali's hilly terrain makes engine condition a priority — always test a car on a steep incline before buying.",
  },
  "addis-ababa": {
    heading: "Buying a Car in Addis Ababa",
    body: "Addis Ababa is Ethiopia's commercial heart and the centre of its car market. The main vehicle market is along Mexico Square (Meskel Square area) and the Kazanchis district. Ethiopia has historically had high import duties, making brand-new cars expensive and giving the secondhand market significant depth. Toyota Land Cruiser is the dominant vehicle for both urban and rural use, valued for its durability on Ethiopia's highland roads. Isuzu trucks and Mitsubishi Pajero also have strong followings. The government has in recent years relaxed some import restrictions, bringing in more Chinese-brand vehicles at competitive prices. When buying in Addis, verify the vehicle's customs clearance documents carefully and use a licensed broker to navigate ERCA (Ethiopian Revenue and Customs Authority) paperwork.",
